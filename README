Please describe your wireless setup, manufacturer and type
(acx100/acx100usb/acx111?) of your hardware. Which firmware image(s)
are you using? If problem is reproducible, #define ACX_DEBUG 2
in acx_config.h and modprobe driver with debug=0xffff.
Post resulting kernel log (bzipped). It is large but very useful
for bug hunting. Try older versions of the driver.
